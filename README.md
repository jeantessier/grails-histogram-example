grails-histogram-example
========================

Someone asked a question on LinkedIn about doing [a pie chart of employees by gender](http://lnkd.in/dxan7nB).  I wrote a quick Grails project to try out a variation on the first commenter.  It pushes the logic into a service and provides a slightly more generic histogram than only male/female.
